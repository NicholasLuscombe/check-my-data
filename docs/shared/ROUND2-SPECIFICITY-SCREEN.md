# Round 2 — the specificity screen, pre-registered

**Fixed S387, before any deposit was acquired and before any result was seen.** The commit date on
this file is the evidence for that, which is the whole reason it exists. P193 records what happened
when condition 3 cited a pre-registration that had never been written.

**Nothing in this document moves after data arrives.** If a rule here turns out to be wrong it is
superseded in a new commit that says so, and the original stays in the record.

## 1 — What this instrument is for

The project has a sensitivity instrument and no specificity instrument.
`REALWORLD-CORPUS-SPEC.md` is a list of independently flagged deposits with third-party ground truth.
It is correctly built and **structurally incapable of producing a false-positive rate**. Round 2 is
not an extension of it. It is the second instrument.

**The question is not the tolerance.** `FALSE-POSITIVE-TOLERANCE.md` bounds the file verdict at under
1% for severity 2 or 3, and demonstrating that needs roughly 300 clean deposits. Thirty cannot do it,
no achievable corpus can, and **the bounds do not move.** Ship with the gap stated — decided S374 and
not reopened here.

**The question is gross malfunction.** Selective Noise fires on 25 of the 26 sheets it reaches, and
nothing in the project distinguishes that from a test that fires on everything. Thirty honestly
sampled deposits settle that either way, and either answer changes what ships.

## 2 — Two arms

P186 established at S383 that batch and ImportView return different verdicts on the same file — two
ladder steps on `C10 :: Exiguobacterium sp. Experiment1`, turning on one click, with the batch default
the accusatory one. **A single-arm screen cannot separate the tests over-firing from the default being
wrong.**

- **Arm A — the batch default.** Each deposit through `BatchView`'s loop as it ships:
  `colRelationship: 'replicates'`, `rowSemantics` from `rsSuggestion.value || 'ordered'`.
- **Arm B — answered honestly.** The same deposit with grouping and row semantics answered from the
  file's own structure, as a user at the ImportView screen would answer them.

**Arm B is the specificity measurement. Arm A minus arm B is the cost of the default.**

## 3 — Sampling rule

**Deposits are drawn without reference to any complaint — never from a flag list, a retraction notice
or a PubPeer thread.**

| | Decision | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Repository** | **Dryad.** | Round 1 is Dryad-sourced and all three CORPUS deposits are Dryad DOIs, so it is the one repository whose files are known to import. A repository whose deposits fail the shape filter measures the parser, not the battery. |
| **Draw** | **Enumerate by deposit date, most recent first. Take the first 30 that pass the shape filter.** | Reproducible by anyone, needs no seed, cannot be re-rolled. A random draw hides a second decision inside the seed. |
| **Window** | **Most recent as of the acquisition date. Record that date in the run log.** | Recency guarantees no overlap with round 1 and needs no exclusion list. |
| **n** | **30. Fixed.** | No deposit added after results are seen, none dropped. |
| **Arm coverage** | **All 30 get both arms.** | A subset confounds the arm comparison with which deposits received the second arm. At n = 30 the second pass is cheap. |

**Shape filter, applied before any analysis runs.** Eligibility is decided from file shape alone —
never from content, subject matter, author, journal, or anything attached to the deposit:

- imports without error (three columns minimum, per P157)
- carries a numeric matrix with replicate or condition structure

**Every rejection is recorded with its reason and its position in the enumeration.** Selection bias
enters at the rejection rule, not at the draw, and a screen whose rejections are invisible cannot be
audited.

**Per deposit, recorded before running:** DOI, deposit date, position in the enumeration, sheet used,
and the arm-B answers with the structural reason for each.

## 4 — Analysis rule

- **Primary reading — arm B file verdicts.** Report counts at each severity over 30. **No rate is
  derived from them.** Thirty deposits cannot carry a rate, and the interval's unit is the deposit,
  not the sheet.
- **Gross malfunction: more than 6 of 30 at severity 2 or 3 on arm B.** Six of thirty is twenty times
  the tolerance, and at n = 30 that many positives puts the lower confidence bound an order of
  magnitude above 1%. At or below six, the screen is consistent with S374's conclusion that this n
  cannot demonstrate the bound either way. Above six, the tool is in a different regime and something
  changes before v1.0.
- **Per-test malfunction: any single test firing on more than half the eligible deposits on arm B**,
  independent of the file verdicts. This is the Selective Noise question and it is why the screen
  exists. Report every test's firing count whether or not it crosses.
- **Default cost — arm A against arm B.** Report the count of deposits whose severity differs between
  arms and the direction of every difference. P185 predicts this is large: the replicate default is
  wrong on all 21 ungrouped real sheets measured so far.

**These deposits are unadjudicated, not honest.** Nothing here establishes that any of them is
genuine. A flag is a flag on a deposit with no known complaint, which is the quantity the screen
measures — and an honest error still counts against the tolerance.

## 5 — What this cannot settle

- **Neither tolerance bound.** Thirty deposits give a one-sided 95% upper limit near 10%.
- **The nine unavoidable rows.** Nine of P186's 25 divergences turn on a click no harness can make,
  so arm A measures the machine's defaults there by construction. Arm B is what reaches past them.
- **Whether any deposit is genuine.** The screen measures the tool, not the data.

## 6 — Rules added S390, before any deposit was acquired

**Nothing above this line changes.** §1–§5 stand as committed at `c125a97`. This section adds rules
that were missing, and it carries the same evidence the original does: the commit date, ahead of the
data. **The enumeration had not begun when this landed.**

Five things were unfixed. Four are fixed here. The fifth is named and left open, because it is about
machinery rather than about what gets analysed.

### 6.1 — What the enumeration is

**The enumeration is one recorded URL.** Build the search in the Dryad web interface, then record the
URL verbatim in the run log with the retrieval timestamp. Swapping `https://datadryad.org/` for
`https://datadryad.org/api/v2/` returns the same result set as JSON, so anyone can reproduce the list
without an account and without a seed.

**Order by the dataset's FIRST publication date, most recent first — not by the current version's
date.** Dryad keeps the DOI across revisions and dates each version separately, so a 2019 deposit
revised last week reads as recent under the version date. **Deposits get revised because somebody
complained.** Round 1 holds eight update pairs for exactly that reason. Sorting on the revision date
would pull a flag list in through the sort, which §3 forbids at the draw.

**Record the version count and every version date per deposit. No deposit is excluded for having more
than one version.** The record makes a later sensitivity read possible without a free choice being
made now.

### 6.2 — Which file, and which sheet

**One sheet per deposit enters the screen.**

- Consider every tabular file in the current version: `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`, `.tsv`. Nothing else is
  considered. A deposit carrying no file in that list is rejected and logged with that reason.
- Take every sheet in every considered file through the product's import and role inference, stopping
  at `extractAnalysisInputs`. **This is the S373 census path. No test runs and no verdict is computed
  while the sheet is being chosen.**
- **The sheet used is the one with the largest cell count — valid rows × data columns — among the
  sheets that pass the shape filter.**
- **Tie-break, in this order:** more data columns; then more valid rows; then file name ascending;
  then sheet index ascending. **C20 produced a tie in round 1 and the census called either choice
  defensible.** A defensible tie before the data is a free choice after it.
- If no sheet passes, the deposit is rejected and logged with its reason and its position.

**Stated in advance, because it has a direction:** a deposit whose largest sheet fails and whose
smaller sheet passes is eligible, and the smaller sheet is what runs. This admits deposits whose main
table is unusable. The alternative — eligibility decided on the largest sheet alone — rejects them,
and measures the parser rather than the battery.

### 6.3 — Depth

**If the first fifty positions yield fewer than ten eligible deposits, stop and report the depth
reached.** A shape filter that rejects four in five is a finding about the corpus, not a reason to
loosen the filter.

**This rule was carried in the S390 opener and was not in this document.** A stopping rule that lives
only in an opener is not pre-registered. It is now.

**There is no other stopping rule, and n = 30 does not move.**

### 6.4 — The order of the arms

**Arm-B answers are written down for a deposit before either arm runs on that deposit.** §3 says
*recorded before running* and does not say before which run. **Answering arm B after seeing arm A's
verdict makes arm B a reaction to it, and arm A minus arm B stops being the cost of the default.**

**The answers and their structural reasons are recorded when they are made and are not revised after
any run.** If an answer turns out to be wrong, log the correction with its reason; do not overwrite.

### 6.5 — Not fixed here

**How arm B is executed.** P186 was measured by hand at ImportView, four runs on one sheet. Nothing
here decides whether thirty arm-B passes are hand-run or driven by a toggle, and **S381's rule stands:
toggle, do not port — a probe adjudicating two implementations must not become a third.** This section
fixes what is analysed. It does not fix the machinery that runs it, and that decision is still owed
before the first deposit.

## 7 — Arm A's sheet, added S390, still before any deposit was acquired

**This amends §2. §6 stands as written, including its count of what it fixed** — this is a new section
rather than a sixth item inside it, so that count stays true.

**Measured at S390, `9fe30bd`.** `BatchView` as it ships calls `parseExcel(file)` with no sheet
argument, `excel.js:51` returns `SheetNames[0]`, and `BatchView.jsx:44` discards the sheet name. **The
shipped batch surface analyses the first sheet of a workbook and never records which one it took.**
§6.2 selects the largest sheet that passes the shape filter. **Those are different files.**

**Arm A is `BatchView`'s loop BODY, run on the §6.2-selected sheet. The file-open path is deliberately
not reproduced.**

Two reasons, and the first is the binding one.

- **Both arms must run on the same sheet or the comparison is confounded.** Arm A minus arm B would
  otherwise mix the cost of the default with the cost of sheet position, and the screen could not
  separate them.
- **The first sheet is not the data sheet.** Round 1's twelve workbooks carry sheets named `Metadata`,
  `Article information`, `Info` and `Column name`. Matching `BatchView`'s open path would let sheet
  order decide what the screen measures.

**What this gives up, stated rather than hidden: the screen does not measure `BatchView`'s sheet-open
behaviour at all.** If taking `SheetNames[0]` silently is itself a defect, it is a register item and
not a finding of this screen. **Do not read a clean arm A as evidence that the open path is sound.**

**Mechanism, confirmed at S390 and needing no `src/` change:** the manifest `sheet` key or `--sheet`,
both feeding `parseExcel`'s existing second parameter.

**Arm B runs on the same sheet.** At `ImportView` the sheet is a user choice, and the user answers with
the §6.2-selected sheet like every other arm-B answer.

**Record per deposit, in addition to §3's list: the selected sheet's name and its position in
`SheetNames`.** The position is what makes the discarded alternative auditable — a later reader can
ask whether first-sheet selection would have changed anything without re-running the screen.

**One instrument doubt is closed and the closure belongs here.** Arm A produced by
`scripts/corpus-run.mjs` reproduces `BatchView` on the `groupingPending` class exactly. Both surfaces
import the same four guards at `engine.js:506`, `:597`, `:604` and `:617`; `BatchView` neither
suspends on the grouping-confirm card nor supplies a default, and neither does the harness.
**S381's "every firing count on those nine is a lower bound" is a statement about the product's reach
with a human at the drill-in. It is not a statement about arm A, and it must not be read as one.**
